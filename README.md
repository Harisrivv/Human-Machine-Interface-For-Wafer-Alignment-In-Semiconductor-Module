# Human Machine Interface for Wafer Alignment in Semiconductor Module

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an embedded system prototype developed for wafer alignment detection and correction in semiconductor processing modules. The system performs real-time sensor acquisition, motor control, and industrial-style Human Machine Interface (HMI) monitoring using a Raspberry Pi platform.

The objective is to simulate an industrial wafer alignment workflow using structured firmware design and proper hardware–software integration.

## Project Highlights
- Modular firmware architecture separating drivers and application logic
- SPI communication with MCP3008 (10-bit ADC)
- Real-time wafer edge detection using LDR sensor
- Threshold-based motor alignment correction
- Emergency stop safety handling mechanism
- 16x2 LCD interface using 4-bit communication mode
- Wafer batch counting system with limit control (0–12)

---

## Technologies & Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi 4
- MCP3008 (10-bit SPI ADC)
- LDR Sensor
- DC Motor with motor driver
- 16x2 LCD Display (4-bit mode)
- Push Buttons (Wafer Detect, Count, Reset, Emergency Stop)
- Status LEDs (Red & Green)
- Node-RED for HMI dashboard visualization

---

## Technical Implementation
The LDR sensor output is read through the MCP3008 ADC using SPI communication. The firmware continuously monitors the light intensity to determine wafer alignment status.

If the measured value crosses the defined threshold, the motor is activated to perform alignment correction. Once proper alignment is achieved, the motor stops and the LCD updates the system status.

The system also includes:
- Wafer presence detection logic
- Batch counting with maximum limit control
- Reset functionality
- Emergency stop override
- LED-based status indication

The firmware is structured for clarity and scalability, following an industry-style project layout.
